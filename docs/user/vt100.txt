ASCII Video Terminal Escape Codes

These are the codes that the terminal will respond to and will send when a special key is pressed. They
emulate most of the functions on both the original DEC VT100 and VT52 terminals. Note that the
symbol ESC means the escape code (decimal 27, hex 1B) and all codes start with this character. For a
more detailed explanation of each code use Google to search for "VT100 User Guide".

The ASCII Video Terminal adds some extensions to the VT100 standard. These include codes to select
36 or 24 lines per screen for VGA, the ability to select from two extra large sized fonts (large and jumbo)
and also codes to draw lines, boxes and circles on the screen.

In the latter case the terms X1 and Y1 refer to the starting position on the screen and X2 and Y2 refer to
the ending position. In the case of a circle R is the radius of the circle. All these variables are in pixels
with the top left hand corner of the screen being X=0 and Y=0. X is the horizontal position and Y is the
vertical with both getting greater as you move away from the top left corner. The overall resolution
depends on the display mode; it is 480x288 pixels in VGA 25 line mode, 480x432 pixels in VGA 36 line
mode, 288x216 in PAL composite and 264x180 pixels in NTSC composite mode

The following example in MMBasic demonstrates how to draw a circle with a radius of 100 pixels at the
centre of the screen (which is at pixel 240 by 144 when in VGA 24 line mode):

PRINT CHR$(27)+"[Z4;240;144;100Z";

(for example, <v> or <h>) represent one or more decimal digits

VT100 Special Key Codes

These are sent from the terminal back to the computer when the particular key is
pressed on the PS2 keyboard. Note that the numeric keypad keys send different
codes in alternate mode. See escape codes above to change the keypad mode.
