	"When Zarathustra was thirty years old, he left his home and the lake of "
	"his home, and went into the mountains.  There he enjoyed his spirit and "
	"solitude, and for ten years did not weary of it.  But at last his heart "
	"changed,--and rising one morning with the rosy dawn, he went before the "
	"sun, and spake thus unto it:\n"
	"Thou great star!  What would be thy happiness if thou hadst not those for "
	"whom thou shinest!\n"
	"For ten years hast thou climbed hither unto my cave:  thou wouldst have "
	"wearied of thy light and of the journey, had it not been for me, mine "
	"eagle, and my serpent.\n"
	"But we awaited thee every morning, took from thee thine overflow "
	"and blessed thee for it.\n"
	"Lo!  I am weary of my wisdom, like the bee that hath gathered too much "
	"honey; I need hands outstretched to take it.\n"
	"I would fain bestow and distribute, until the wise have once more become "
	"joyous in their folly, and the poor happy in their riches.\n"
	"Therefore must I descend into the deep:  as thou doest in the evening, "
	"when thou goest behind the sea, and givest light "
	"also to the nether-world, "
	"thou exuberant star!\n"
	"Like thee must I GO DOWN, as men say, to whom I shall descend.\n"
	"Bless me, then, thou tranquil eye, that canst behold even the greatest "
	"happiness without envy!\n"
	"Bless the cup that is about to overflow, "
	"that the water may flow golden out "
	"of it, and carry everywhere the reflection of thy bliss!\n"
	"Lo!  This cup is again going to empty itself, and Zarathustra is again "
	"going to be a man.\n"
	"Thus began Zarathustra's down-going.\n\n"

	"Zarathustra went down the mountain alone, no one meeting him.  When he "
	"entered the forest, however, there suddenly stood before him an old man, "
	"who had left his holy cot to seek roots.  And thus spake the old man to "
	"Zarathustra:\n"
	"\"No stranger to me is this wanderer:  many years ago passed he by. "
	"Zarathustra he was called; but he hath altered.\n"
	"Then thou carriedst thine ashes into the mountains:  wilt thou now carry "
	"thy fire into the valleys?  Fearest thou not the incendiary's doom?\n"
	"Yea, I recognise Zarathustra.  Pure is his eye, and no loathing lurketh "
	"about his mouth.  Goeth he not along like a dancer?\n"
	"Altered is Zarathustra; a child hath Zarathustra become; "
	"an awakened one is "
	"Zarathustra:  what wilt thou do in the land of the sleepers?\n"
	"As in the sea hast thou lived in solitude, and it hath borne thee up. "
	"Alas, wilt thou now go ashore?  Alas, wilt thou again drag thy body "
	"thyself?\"\n"
	"Zarathustra answered:  \"I love mankind.\"\n"
	"\"Why,\" said the saint, \"did I go into the forest and the desert?  "
	"Was it "
	"not because I loved men far too well?\n"
	"Now I love God:  men, I do not love.  "
	"Man is a thing too imperfect for me. "
	"Love to man would be fatal to me.\"\n"
	"Zarathustra answered:  \"What spake I of love!  I am bringing gifts unto "
	"men.\"\n"
	"\"Give them nothing,\" said the saint.  "
	"\"Take rather part of their load, and "
	"carry it along with them--that will be most agreeable unto them:  if only "
	"it be agreeable unto thee!\n"
	"If, however, thou wilt give unto them, "
	"give them no more than an alms, and "
	"let them also beg for it!\"\n"
	"\"No,\" replied Zarathustra, \"I give no alms.  I am not poor enough for "
	"that.\"\n"
	"The saint laughed at Zarathustra, and spake thus:  \"Then see to it that "
	"they accept thy treasures!  They are distrustful "
	"of anchorites, and do not "
	"believe that we come with gifts.\n"
	"The fall of our footsteps ringeth too hollow through their streets.  And "
	"just as at night, when they are in bed and hear a man abroad long before "
	"sunrise, so they ask themselves concerning us:  Where goeth the thief?\n"
	"Go not to men, but stay in the forest!  "
	"Go rather to the animals!  Why not "
	"be like me--a bear amongst bears, a bird amongst birds?\"\n"
	"\"And what doeth the saint in the forest?\" asked Zarathustra.\n"
	"The saint answered:  \"I make hymns and sing them; and in making hymns "
	"I laugh and weep and mumble:  thus do I praise God.\n"
	"With singing, weeping, laughing, "
	"and mumbling do I praise the God who is my "
	"God.  But what dost thou bring us as a gift?\"\n"
	"When Zarathustra had heard these words, he bowed to the saint and said: "
	"\"What should I have to give thee!  Let me rather hurry hence lest I take "
	"aught away from thee!\"--And thus they parted "
	"from one another, the old man "
	"and Zarathustra, laughing like schoolboys.\n"
	"When Zarathustra was alone, however, he said to his heart:  \"Could it be "
	"possible!  This old saint in the forest "
	"hath not yet heard of it, that GOD "
	"IS DEAD!\"\n\n"

	"When Zarathustra arrived at the nearest town which "
	"adjoineth the forest, he "
	"found many people assembled in the market-place; "
	"for it had been announced "
	"that a rope-dancer would give a performance.  "
	"And Zarathustra spake thus "
	"unto the people:\n"
	"I TEACH YOU THE SUPERMAN.  "
	"Man is something that is to be surpassed.  What "
	"have ye done to surpass man?\n"
	"All beings hitherto have created something "
	"beyond themselves:  and ye want "
	"to be the ebb of that great tide, and would rather go back to the beast "
	"than surpass man?\n"
	"What is the ape to man?  A laughing-stock, "
	"a thing of shame.  And just the "
	"same shall man be to the Superman:  a laughing-stock, a thing of shame.\n"
	"Ye have made your way from the worm to man, and much within you is still "
	"worm.  Once were ye apes, and even yet man is more of an ape than any of "
	"the apes.\n"
	"Even the wisest among you is only a disharmony and hybrid of plant and "
	"phantom.  But do I bid you become phantoms or plants?\n"
	"Lo, I teach you the Superman!\n"
	"The Superman is the meaning of the earth.  "
	"Let your will say:  The Superman "
	"SHALL BE the meaning of the earth!\n"
	"I conjure you, my brethren, REMAIN TRUE TO THE EARTH, "
	"and believe not those "
	"who speak unto you of superearthly hopes!  "
	"Poisoners are they, whether they "
	"know it or not.\n"
	"Despisers of life are they, decaying ones "
	"and poisoned ones themselves, of "
	"whom the earth is weary:  so away with them!\n"
	"Once blasphemy against God was the greatest blasphemy; but God died, and "
	"therewith also those blasphemers.  To blaspheme the earth is now the "
	"dreadfulest sin, and to rate the heart of the unknowable higher than the "
	"meaning of the earth!\n"
	"Once the soul looked contemptuously on the "
	"body, and then that contempt was "
	"the supreme thing:--the soul wished the body "
	"meagre, ghastly, and famished. "
	"Thus it thought to escape from the body and the earth.\n"
	"Oh, that soul was itself meagre, ghastly, and "
	"famished; and cruelty was the "
	"delight of that soul!\n"
	"But ye, also, my brethren, tell me:  What doth your body say about your "
	"soul?  Is your soul not poverty and pollution and wretched self- "
	"complacency?\n"
	"Verily, a polluted stream is man.  "
	"One must be a sea, to receive a polluted "
	"stream without becoming impure.\n"
	"Lo, I teach you the Superman:  he is that sea; in him can your great "
	"contempt be submerged.\n"
	"What is the greatest thing ye can experience?  It is the hour of great "
	"contempt.  The hour in which even your happiness becometh loathsome unto "
	"you, and so also your reason and virtue.\n"
	"The hour when ye say:  \"What good is my happiness!  It is poverty and "
	"pollution and wretched self-complacency.  But my happiness should justify "
	"existence itself!\"\n"
	"The hour when ye say:  \"What good is my "
	"reason!  Doth it long for knowledge "
	"as the lion for his food?  It is poverty and pollution and wretched self- "
	"complacency!\"\n"
	"The hour when ye say:  \"What good is my virtue!  "
	"As yet it hath not made me "
	"passionate.  How weary I am of my good and my bad!  It is all poverty and "
	"pollution and wretched self-complacency!\"\n"
	"The hour when ye say:  \"What good is my justice!  I do not see that I am "
	"fervour and fuel.  The just, however, are fervour and fuel!\"\n"
	"The hour when we say:  \"What good is my pity!  Is not pity the cross on "
	"which he is nailed who loveth man?  But my pity is not a crucifixion.\"\n"
	"Have ye ever spoken thus?  Have ye ever cried thus?  Ah! would that I had "
	"heard you crying thus!\n"
	"It is not your sin--it is your self-satisfaction that crieth unto heaven; "
	"your very sparingness in sin crieth unto heaven!\n"
	"Where is the lightning to lick you with its tongue?  Where is the frenzy "
	"with which ye should be inoculated?\n"
	"Lo, I teach you the Superman:  "
	"he is that lightning, he is that frenzy!--\n"
	"When Zarathustra had thus spoken, one "
	"of the people called out:  \"We have "
	"now heard enough of the rope-dancer; it is time now for us to see him!\" "
	"And all the people laughed at Zarathustra.  But the rope-dancer, who "
	"thought the words applied to him, began his performance.\n\n"

		"Zarathustra, however, looked at the people and wondered.  Then he spake\nthus:\n"
		"Man is a rope stretched between the animal and the Superman--a rope over an "
		"abyss.\n"
		"A dangerous crossing, a dangerous wayfaring, a dangerous looking-back, a "
		"dangerous trembling and halting.\n"
		"What is great in man is that he is a bridge and not a goal:  what is "
		"lovable in man is that he is an OVER-GOING and a DOWN-GOING.\n"
		"I love those that know not how to live except as down-goers, for they are "
		"the over-goers.\n"
		"I love the great despisers, because they are the great adorers, and arrows "
		"of longing for the other shore.\n"
		"I love those who do not first seek a reason beyond the stars for going down "
		"and being sacrifices, but sacrifice themselves to the earth, that the earth "
		"of the Superman may hereafter arrive.\n"
		"I love him who liveth in order to know, and seeketh to know in order that "
		"the Superman may hereafter live.  Thus seeketh he his own down-going.\n"
		"I love him who laboureth and inventeth, that he may build the house for the "
		"Superman, and prepare for him earth, animal, and plant:  for thus seeketh "
		"he his own down-going.\n"
		"I love him who loveth his virtue:  for virtue is the will to down-going, "
		"and an arrow of longing.\n"
		"I love him who reserveth no share of spirit for himself, but wanteth to be "
		"wholly the spirit of his virtue:  thus walketh he as spirit over the "
		"bridge.\n"
		"I love him who maketh his virtue his inclination and destiny:  thus, for "
		"the sake of his virtue, he is willing to live on, or live no more.\n"
		"I love him who desireth not too many virtues.  One virtue is more of a "
		"virtue than two, because it is more of a knot for one's destiny to cling "
		"to.\n"
		"I love him whose soul is lavish, who wanteth no thanks and doth not give "
		"back:  for he always bestoweth, and desireth not to keep for himself.\n"
		"I love him who is ashamed when the dice fall in his favour, and who then "
		"asketh:  \"Am I a dishonest player?\"--for he is willing to succumb.\n"
		"I love him who scattereth golden words in advance of his deeds, and always "
		"doeth more than he promiseth:  for he seeketh his own down-going.\n"
		"I love him who justifieth the future ones, and redeemeth the past ones:  "
		"for he is willing to succumb through the present ones.\n"
		"I love him who chasteneth his God, because he loveth his God:  for he must "
		"succumb through the wrath of his God.\n"
		"I love him whose soul is deep even in the wounding, and may succumb through "
		"a small matter:  thus goeth he willingly over the bridge.\n"
		"I love him whose soul is so overfull that he forgetteth himself, and all "
		"things are in him:  thus all things become his down-going.\n"
		"I love him who is of a free spirit and a free heart:  thus is his head only "
		"the bowels of his heart; his heart, however, causeth his down-going.\n"
		"I love all who are like heavy drops falling one by one out of the dark "
		"cloud that lowereth over man:  they herald the coming of the lightning, and "
		"succumb as heralds.\n"
		"Lo, I am a herald of the lightning, and a heavy drop out of the cloud:  the "
		"lightning, however, is the SUPERMAN.--\n\n"

		"When Zarathustra had spoken these words, he again looked at the people, and "
		"was silent.  \"There they stand,\" said he to his heart; \"there they laugh:  "
		"they understand me not; I am not the mouth for these ears.\n"
		"Must one first batter their ears, that they may learn to hear with their "
		"eyes?  Must one clatter like kettledrums and penitential preachers?  Or do "
		"they only believe the stammerer?\n"
		"They have something whereof they are proud.  What do they call it, that "
		"which maketh them proud?  Culture, they call it; it distinguisheth them "
		"from the goatherds.\n"
		"They dislike, therefore, to hear of 'contempt' of themselves.  So I will "
		"appeal to their pride.\n"
		"I will speak unto them of the most contemptible thing:  that, however, is "
		"THE LAST MAN!\"\n"
		"And thus spake Zarathustra unto the people:\n"
		"It is time for man to fix his goal.  It is time for man to plant the germ "
		"of his highest hope.\n"
		"Still is his soil rich enough for it.  But that soil will one day be poor "
		"and exhausted, and no lofty tree will any longer be able to grow thereon.\n"
		"Alas! there cometh the time when man will no longer launch the arrow of his "
		"longing beyond man--and the string of his bow will have unlearned to whizz!\n"
		"I tell you:  one must still have chaos in one, to give birth to a dancing "
		"star.  I tell you:  ye have still chaos in you.\n"
		"Alas!  There cometh the time when man will no longer give birth to any "
		"star.  Alas!  There cometh the time of the most despicable man, who can no "
		"longer despise himself.\n"
		"Lo!  I show you THE LAST MAN.\n"
		"\"What is love?  What is creation?  What is longing?  What is a star?\"--so "
		"asketh the last man and blinketh.\n"
		"The earth hath then become small, and on it there hoppeth the last man who "
		"maketh everything small.  His species is ineradicable like that of the "
		"ground-flea; the last man liveth longest.\n"
		"\"We have discovered happiness\"--say the last men, and blink thereby.\n"
		"They have left the regions where it is hard to live; for they need warmth.  "
		"One still loveth one's neighbour and rubbeth against him; for one needeth "
		"warmth.\n"
		"Turning ill and being distrustful, they consider sinful:  they walk warily.  "
		"He is a fool who still stumbleth over stones or men!\n"
		"A little poison now and then:  that maketh pleasant dreams.  And much "
		"poison at last for a pleasant death.\n"
		"One still worketh, for work is a pastime.  But one is careful lest the "
		"pastime should hurt one.\n"
		"One no longer becometh poor or rich; both are too burdensome.  Who still "
		"wanteth to rule?  Who still wanteth to obey?  Both are too burdensome.\n"
		"No shepherd, and one herd!  Every one wanteth the same; every one is equal:  "
		"he who hath other sentiments goeth voluntarily into the madhouse.\n"
		"\"Formerly all the world was insane,\"--say the subtlest of them, and blink "
		"thereby.\n"
		"They are clever and know all that hath happened:  so there is no end to "
		"their raillery.  People still fall out, but are soon reconciled--otherwise "
		"it spoileth their stomachs.\n"
		"They have their little pleasures for the day, and their little pleasures "
		"for the night, but they have a regard for health.\n"
		"\"We have discovered happiness,\"--say the last men, and blink thereby.--\n"
		"And here ended the first discourse of Zarathustra, which is also called "
		"\"The Prologue\":  for at this point the shouting and mirth of the multitude "
		"interrupted him.  \"Give us this last man, O Zarathustra,\"--they called out- "
		"-\"make us into these last men!  Then will we make thee a present of the "
		"Superman!\"  And all the people exulted and smacked their lips.  "
		"Zarathustra, however, turned sad, and said to his heart:\n"
		"\"They understand me not:  I am not the mouth for these ears.\n"
		"Too long, perhaps, have I lived in the mountains; too much have I hearkened "
		"unto the brooks and trees:  now do I speak unto them as unto the goatherds.\n"
		"Calm is my soul, and clear, like the mountains in the morning.  But they "
		"think me cold, and a mocker with terrible jests.\n"
		"And now do they look at me and laugh:  and while they laugh they hate me "
		"too.  There is ice in their laughter.\"\n\n"

		"Then, however, something happened which made every mouth mute and every eye "
		"fixed.  In the meantime, of course, the rope-dancer had commenced his "
		"performance:  he had come out at a little door, and was going along the "
		"rope which was stretched between two towers, so that it hung above the "
		"market-place and the people.  When he was just midway across, the little "
		"door opened once more, and a gaudily-dressed fellow like a buffoon sprang "
		"out, and went rapidly after the first one.  \"Go on, halt-foot,\" cried his "
		"frightful voice, \"go on, lazy-bones, interloper, sallow-face!--lest I "
		"tickle thee with my heel!  What dost thou here between the towers?  In the "
		"tower is the place for thee, thou shouldst be locked up; to one better than "
		"thyself thou blockest the way!\"--And with every word he came nearer and "
		"nearer the first one.  When, however, he was but a step behind, there "
		"happened the frightful thing which made every mouth mute and every eye "
		"fixed--he uttered a yell like a devil, and jumped over the other who was in "
		"his way.  The latter, however, when he thus saw his rival triumph, lost at "
		"the same time his head and his footing on the rope; he threw his pole away, "
		"and shot downwards faster than it, like an eddy of arms and legs, into the "
		"depth.  The market-place and the people were like the sea when the storm "
		"cometh on:  they all flew apart and in disorder, especially where the body "
		"was about to fall.\n"
		"Zarathustra, however, remained standing, and just beside him fell the body, "
		"badly injured and disfigured, but not yet dead.  After a while "
		"consciousness returned to the shattered man, and he saw Zarathustra "
		"kneeling beside him.  \"What art thou doing there?\" said he at last, \"I knew "
		"long ago that the devil would trip me up.  Now he draggeth me to hell:  "
		"wilt thou prevent him?\"\n"
		"\"On mine honour, my friend,\" answered Zarathustra, \"there is nothing of all "
		"that whereof thou speakest:  there is no devil and no hell.  Thy soul will "
		"be dead even sooner than thy body:  fear, therefore, nothing any more!\"\n"
		"The man looked up distrustfully.  \"If thou speakest the truth,\" said he, \"I "
		"lose nothing when I lose my life.  I am not much more than an animal which "
		"hath been taught to dance by blows and scanty fare.\"\n"
		"\"Not at all,\" said Zarathustra, \"thou hast made danger thy calling; therein "
		"there is nothing contemptible.  Now thou perishest by thy calling:  "
		"therefore will I bury thee with mine own hands.\"\n"
		"When Zarathustra had said this the dying one did not reply further; but he "
		"moved his hand as if he sought the hand of Zarathustra in gratitude.\n\n"
};

const char zarathustra_7[] = {

		"Meanwhile the evening came on, and the market-place veiled itself in gloom.  "
		"Then the people dispersed, for even curiosity and terror become fatigued.  "
		"Zarathustra, however, still sat beside the dead man on the ground, absorbed "
		"in thought:  so he forgot the time.  But at last it became night, and a "
		"cold wind blew upon the lonely one.  Then arose Zarathustra and said to his "
		"heart:\n"
		"Verily, a fine catch of fish hath Zarathustra made to-day!  It is not a man "
		"he hath caught, but a corpse.\n"
		"Sombre is human life, and as yet without meaning:  a buffoon may be fateful "
		"to it.\n"
		"I want to teach men the sense of their existence, which is the Superman, "
		"the lightning out of the dark cloud--man.\n"
		"But still am I far from them, and my sense speaketh not unto their sense.  "
		"To men I am still something between a fool and a corpse.\n"
		"Gloomy is the night, gloomy are the ways of Zarathustra.  Come, thou cold "
		"and stiff companion!  I carry thee to the place where I shall bury thee "
		"with mine own hands.\n\n"
};

const char zarathustra_8[] = {
	"8.\n\n"
		"When Zarathustra had said this to his heart, he put the corpse upon his "
		"shoulders and set out on his way.  Yet had he not gone a hundred steps, "
		"when there stole a man up to him and whispered in his ear--and lo! he that "
		"spake was the buffoon from the tower.  \"Leave this town, O Zarathustra,\""
		"said he, \"there are too many here who hate thee.  The good and just hate "
		"thee, and call thee their enemy and despiser; the believers in the orthodox "
		"belief hate thee, and call thee a danger to the multitude.  It was thy good "
		"fortune to be laughed at:  and verily thou spakest like a buffoon.  It was "
		"thy good fortune to associate with the dead dog; by so humiliating thyself "
		"thou hast saved thy life to-day.  Depart, however, from this town,--or "
		"tomorrow I shall jump over thee, a living man over a dead one.\"  And when "
		"he had said this, the buffoon vanished; Zarathustra, however, went on "
		"through the dark streets.\n"
		"At the gate of the town the grave-diggers met him:  they shone their torch "
		"on his face, and, recognising Zarathustra, they sorely derided him.  "
		"\"Zarathustra is carrying away the dead dog:  a fine thing that Zarathustra "
		"hath turned a grave-digger!  For our hands are too cleanly for that roast.  "
		"Will Zarathustra steal the bite from the devil?  Well then, good luck to "
		"the repast!  If only the devil is not a better thief than Zarathustra!--he "
		"will steal them both, he will eat them both!\"  And they laughed among "
		"themselves, and put their heads together.\n"
		"Zarathustra made no answer thereto, but went on his way.  When he had gone "
		"on for two hours, past forests and swamps, he had heard too much of the "
		"hungry howling of the wolves, and he himself became a-hungry.  So he halted "
		"at a lonely house in which a light was burning.\n"
		"\"Hunger attacketh me,\" said Zarathustra, \"like a robber.  Among forests and "
		"swamps my hunger attacketh me, and late in the night.\n"
		"\"Strange humours hath my hunger.  Often it cometh to me only after a "
		"repast, and all day it hath failed to come:  where hath it been?\"\n"
		"And thereupon Zarathustra knocked at the door of the house.  An old man "
		"appeared, who carried a light, and asked:  \"Who cometh unto me and my bad "
		"sleep?\"\n"
		"\"A living man and a dead one,\" said Zarathustra.  \"Give me something to eat "
		"and drink, I forgot it during the day.  He that feedeth the hungry "
		"refresheth his own soul, saith wisdom.\"\n"
		"The old man withdrew, but came back immediately and offered Zarathustra "
		"bread and wine.  \"A bad country for the hungry,\" said he; \"that is why I "
		"live here.  Animal and man come unto me, the anchorite.  But bid thy "
		"companion eat and drink also, he is wearier than thou.\"  Zarathustra "
		"answered:  \"My companion is dead; I shall hardly be able to persuade him to "
		"eat.\"  \"That doth not concern me,\" said the old man sullenly; \"he that "
		"knocketh at my door must take what I offer him.  Eat, and fare ye well!\"--\n"
		"Thereafter Zarathustra again went on for two hours, trusting to the path "
		"and the light of the stars:  for he was an experienced night-walker, and "
		"liked to look into the face of all that slept.  When the morning dawned, "

		"Long slept Zarathustra; and not only the rosy dawn passed over his "

		"amazedly he gazed into the forest and the stillness, amazedly he gazed "
		"into himself.  Then he arose quickly, like a seafarer who all at once "
		"seeth the land; and he shouted for joy:  for he saw a new truth.  And he "
		"spake thus to his heart:\n"
		"A light hath dawned upon me:  I need companions--living ones; not "
		"dead companions and corpses, which I carry with me where I will.\n"
		"But I need living companions, who will follow me because they want "
		"to follow themselves--and to the place where I will.\n"
		"A light hath dawned upon me.  Not to the people is Zarathustra to speak, "
		"but to companions!  Zarathustra shall not be the herd's herdsman and hound!\n"
		"To allure many from the herd--for that purpose have I come.  The people and "
		"the herd must be angry with me:  a robber shall Zarathustra be called by "
		"the herdsmen.\n"
		"Herdsmen, I say, but they call themselves the good and just.  Herdsmen, I "
		"say, but they call themselves the believers in the orthodox belief.\n"
		"Behold the good and just!  Whom do they hate most?  Him who breaketh up "
		"their tables of values, the breaker, the lawbreaker:--he, however, is the "
		"creator.\n"
		"Behold the believers of all beliefs!  Whom do they hate most?  Him who "
		"breaketh up their tables of values, the breaker, the law-breaker--he, "
		"however, is the creator.\n"
		"Companions, the creator seeketh, not corpses--and not herds or believers "
		"either.  Fellow-creators the creator seeketh--those who grave new values on "
		"new tables.\n"
		"Companions, the creator seeketh, and fellow-reapers:  for everything is "
		"ripe for the harvest with him.  But he lacketh the hundred sickles:  so he "
		"plucketh the ears of corn and is vexed.\n"
		"Companions, the creator seeketh, and such as know how to whet their "
		"sickles.  Destroyers, will they be called, and despisers of good and evil.  "
		"But they are the reapers and rejoicers.\n"
		"Fellow-creators, Zarathustra seeketh; fellow-reapers and fellow-rejoicers, "
		"Zarathustra seeketh:  what hath he to do with herds and herdsmen and "
		"corpses!\n"
		"And thou, my first companion, rest in peace!  Well have I buried thee in "
		"thy hollow tree; well have I hid thee from the wolves.\n"
		"But I part from thee; the time hath arrived.  'Twixt rosy dawn and rosy "
		"dawn there came unto me a new truth.\n"
		"I am not to be a herdsman, I am not to be a grave-digger.  Not any more "
		"will I discourse unto the people; for the last time have I spoken unto the "
		"dead.\n"
		"With the creators, the reapers, and the rejoicers will I associate:  the "
		"rainbow will I show them, and all the stairs to the Superman.\n"
		"To the lone-dwellers will I sing my song, and to the twain-dwellers; and "
		"unto him who hath still ears for the unheard, will I make the heart heavy "
		"with my happiness.\n"
		"I make for my goal, I follow my course; over the loitering and tardy will I "
		"leap.  Thus let my on-going be their down-going!\n\n"

		"This had Zarathustra said to his heart when the sun stood at noon-tide.  "
		"Then he looked inquiringly aloft,--for he heard above him the sharp call of "
		"a bird.  And behold!  An eagle swept through the air in wide circles, and "
		"on it hung a serpent, not like a prey, but like a friend:  for it kept "
		"itself coiled round the eagle's neck.\n"

		"More dangerous have I found it among men than among animals; in dangerous "
		"paths goeth Zarathustra.  Let mine animals lead me!\n"

		"But I am asking the impossible.  Therefore do I ask my pride to go always "
		"with my wisdom!\n"
