   begins when the transmitter is ready to transmit, but is prevented because 
   of an active CRS (carrier sense) signal on the MII. Defer time is not 
   cumulative. If the transmitter defers for 10 000 bit times, then 
   transmits, collides, backs off, and then has to defer again after 
   completion of back-off, the deferral timer resets to 0 and restarts.

This bit initiates a Pause Control frame in Full-duplex mode and activates the back pressure

In Full-duplex mode, this bit should be read as 0 before writing to the Flow control register. To

In Half-duplex mode, when this bit is set (and TFCE is set), back pressure is asserted by the
