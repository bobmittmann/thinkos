/* If the endpoint is non-isochronous, this bit contains the required value of
   the data toggle bit (0=DATA0, 1=DATA1) for the next data packet to be
   transmitted. Hardware toggles this bit when the ACK handshake is received
   from the USB host, following a data packet transmission. If the endpoint is
   defined as a control one, hardware sets this bit to 1 at the reception of a
   SETUP PID addressed to this endpoint. If the endpoint is using the double
   buffer feature, this bit is used to support packet buffer swapping too
   (Refer to Section 23.4.3: Double-buffered endpoints) If the endpoint is
   Isochronous, this bit is used to support packet buffer swapping since no
   data toggling is used for this sort of endpoints and only DATA0 packet are
   transmitted (Refer to Section 23.4.4: Isochronous transfers). Hardware
   toggles this bit just after the end of data packet transmission, since no
   handshake is used for Isochronous transfers. This bit can also be toggled by 
   the software to initialize its value (mandatory when the endpoint is not a
   control one) or to force a specific data toggle/packet buffer usage. When
   the application software writes ‘0, the value of DTOG_TX remains
   unchanged, while writing ‘1 makes the bit value toggle. This bit is
   read/write but it can only be toggled by writing 1. */

/* These bits contain the information

   the software to initialize their value. When the application software writes
   ‘0, the value remains unchanged, while writing ‘1 makes the bit value
   toggle. Hardware sets the STAT_TX bits to NAK, when a correct transfer has
   occurred (CTR_TX=1) corresponding to a IN or SETUP (control only) transaction 
   addressed to this endpoint. It then waits for the software to prepare the
   next set of data to be transmitted. Double-buffered bulk endpoints implement
   a special transaction flow control, which controls the status based on buffer 
   availability condition (Refer to Section 23.4.3: Double-buffered endpoints).
   If the endpoint is defined as Isochronous, its status can only be “VALID” 
   or “DISABLED”. Therefore, the hardware cannot change the status of the
   endpoint after a successful transaction. If the software sets the STAT_TX
   bits to ‘STALL’ or ‘NAK’ for an Isochronous endpoint, the USB
   peripheral behavior is not defined. These bits are read/write but they can be 
   only toggled by writing ‘1. */
